# Cloud Storage Implementation - Firebase Firestore

## Overview
**MAJOR UPDATE**: Game history now saved to Firebase Firestore instead of local storage. Each user's games are stored in the cloud and accessible from any device.

## Date: October 6, 2025

---

## 🔥 What Changed

### **Before** (Local Storage):
- Games saved to device only (SharedPreferences)
- Lost if app deleted or device changed
- No sync between devices
- No way to see other users' games

### **After** (Cloud Storage):
- ✅ Games saved to Firebase Firestore
- ✅ Accessible from any device
- ✅ Tied to user account (email)
- ✅ Never lost (unless manually deleted)
- ✅ Real-time sync
- ✅ Each user sees only their own games

## 📊 Database Structure

### Firestore Collection Hierarchy:
```
firestore
└── users (collection)
    └── {userId} (document)
        └── games (subcollection)
            ├── {gameId1} (document)
            │   ├── timestamp: DateTime
            │   ├── numberOfPlayers: int
            │   ├── startingCards: int
            │   ├── scoreMode: int
            │   ├── winnerId: string
            │   ├── userId: string
            │   └── playerScores: array
            │       ├── id: string
            │       ├── name: string
            │       ├── totalScore: int
            │       └── isWinner: bool
            ├── {gameId2} (document)
            └── {gameId3} (document)
```

### Example Firestore Path:
```
/users/abc123xyz/games/game456def
```

Where:
- `abc123xyz` = User's Firebase Auth UID
- `game456def` = Auto-generated game document ID

## 🆕 New Service: CloudGameHistoryService

**File**: `lib/services/cloud_game_history_service.dart` (NEW)

### Key Features:

#### 1. Save Game to Cloud
```dart
await CloudGameHistoryService().saveGame(gameHistory);
```
- Saves to Firestore under current user's account
- Auto-generates unique document ID
- Includes server timestamp
- Links to user ID

#### 2. Load User's Game History
```dart
List<GameHistory> games = await CloudGameHistoryService().getHistory();
```
- Fetches only current user's games
- Sorted by timestamp (newest first)
- Limited to last 50 games
- Returns empty list if user not logged in

#### 3. Delete Specific Game
```dart
await CloudGameHistoryService().deleteGame(gameDocumentId);
```
- Deletes by document ID (not index)
- Only deletes from current user's collection
- Permanent deletion

#### 4. Clear All History
```dart
await CloudGameHistoryService().clearHistory();
```
- Deletes ALL games for current user
- Uses batch operation for efficiency
- Confirmation required in UI

#### 5. Get User Statistics
```dart
Map<String, dynamic> stats = await CloudGameHistoryService().getUserStats();
// Returns: { totalGames: 10, totalWins: 4, winRate: 40.0 }
```
- Calculates total games played
- Counts wins for current user
- Computes win percentage

#### 6. Real-time Updates (Stream)
```dart
Stream<List<GameHistory>> stream = CloudGameHistoryService().getHistoryStream();
```
- Live updates when games are added/deleted
- Useful for real-time dashboard

## 🔄 Updated Model: GameHistory

**File**: `lib/models/game_history_model.dart`

### New Field Added:
```dart
final String? id; // Firestore document ID
```

### Why?
- Needed to delete specific games from Firestore
- Can be null for backward compatibility
- Auto-populated when loading from Firestore

### Updated fromJson:
```dart
factory GameHistory.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
  return GameHistory(
    id: json['id'], // NEW
    timestamp: json['timestamp'] is String 
        ? DateTime.parse(json['timestamp'])
        : (json['timestamp'] as dynamic).toDate(), // Handle Firestore Timestamp
    // ... rest of fields
  );
}
```

**Handles Two Timestamp Formats**:
1. String (ISO 8601) - from old local storage
2. Firestore Timestamp - from cloud storage

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### New User First Game:
```
1. Register/Login ✅
2. Play game ✅
3. Game ends → Saves to Firestore automatically ✅
4. Open Score History → See your game ✅
```

### Existing User (Multiple Devices):
```
Device A:
1. Login with user@email.com
2. Play 3 games
3. Games saved to Firestore

Device B (Later):
1. Login with user@email.com
2. Open Score History
3. ✅ See all 3 games from Device A!
```

### Different Users:
```
User A (alice@email.com):
- Plays 5 games
- Sees only her 5 games

User B (bob@email.com):
- Plays 3 games
- Sees only his 3 games
- ✅ Cannot see Alice's games
```

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Firestore Security Rules (Recommended):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own games
    match /users/{userId}/games/{gameId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
                         && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### What This Does:
- ✅ Users must be logged in
- ✅ Users can only access their own games
- ✅ No one can see other users' games
- ✅ No anonymous access

## 📊 Firebase Console Verification

### How to Check Data:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Firestore Database" in left menu
4. Navigate to: `users → {userId} → games`
5. See all games for that user

### Example View:
```
📁 users
  └── 📄 abc123xyz (User A)
       └── 📁 games
            ├── 📄 game1 (timestamp: Oct 6, 2025 10:30 AM)
            ├── 📄 game2 (timestamp: Oct 6, 2025 11:15 AM)
            └── 📄 game3 (timestamp: Oct 6, 2025 2:45 PM)
  └── 📄 def456uvw (User B)
       └── 📁 games
            └── 📄 game4 (timestamp: Oct 6, 2025 3:00 PM)
```

## ⚡ Performance

### Read Operations:
- Fetches only current user's games
- Limited to 50 most recent
- Indexed by timestamp for speed

### Write Operations:
- Async save (doesn't block UI)
- Server timestamp for consistency
- Batch delete for clearing history

### Network:
- Only loads when Score History opened
- Cached by Firestore automatically
- Works offline (pending sync when online)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Easy to Add Now:

1. **User Stats Dashboard**:
```dart
final stats = await CloudGameHistoryService().getUserStats();
print('Total games: ${stats['totalGames']}');
print('Win rate: ${stats['winRate']}%');
```

2. **Leaderboards**:
```dart
// Query top players across all users
firestore.collectionGroup('games')
  .orderBy('playerScores.totalScore', descending: true)
  .limit(10);
```

3. **Game Sharing**:
```dart
// Make a game public
gameDoc.set({'isPublic': true, 'shareCode': 'ABC123'});
```

4. **Friend System**:
```dart
// Add friends subcollection
/users/{userId}/friends/{friendId}
```

5. **Achievements**:
```dart
// Track milestones
if (totalGames == 100) {
  awardAchievement('century_player');
}
```

## 💾 Migration Notes

### Old Local Data:
- Games saved before this update are still on device
- Located in SharedPreferences
- **Not automatically migrated to cloud**

### To Migrate Old Data:
```dart
// Run once to migrate
final localService = GameHistoryService();
final cloudService = CloudGameHistoryService();

final localGames = await localService.getHistory();
for (var game in localGames) {
  await cloudService.saveGame(game);
}
```

### Or Just:
- Old games stay on device
- New games go to cloud
- User can manually delete old local history

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

### No Internet:
- Firestore queues operations
- Syncs when connection restored
- User sees cached data

### User Not Logged In:
- Service returns empty list
- Save operations fail gracefully
- No crash, just debug print

### Permission Denied:
- Check Firestore security rules
- Ensure user authenticated
- Verify userId matches

---

## 📞 Common Questions

### Q: Can I see other users' games?
**A:** No, each user sees only their own games. Firestore security rules prevent cross-user access.

### Q: What happens if I delete my account?
**A:** All game data under that user ID remains in Firestore. You'd need to manually delete it first or set up automatic cleanup.

### Q: Is there a limit to how many games I can save?
**A:** Currently limited to 50 most recent games per user (can be changed). Firestore itself has no practical limit.

### Q: Does this cost money?
**A:** Firebase has a free tier:
- 50K reads/day free
- 20K writes/day free
- 1GB storage free
- More than enough for personal use!

### Q: What if Firestore is down?
**A:** Firestore has 99.95% uptime. Offline cache means users still see their data. Writes queue until connection restored.
