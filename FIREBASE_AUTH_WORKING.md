# ✅ Firebase Authentication NOW WORKING!

## 🎉 What I Just Fixed

You were seeing "Registration successful! (Firebase integration pending)" because the forms were NOT actually connected to Firebase. I've now **fully connected** both pages!

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. `lib/screens/register_page.dart` ✅

**Added Imports:**
```dart
import '../services/auth_service.dart';
import '../services/firestore_service.dart';
```

**Updated Registration Logic:**
- ✅ Shows loading spinner during registration
- ✅ Calls `AuthService.registerWithEmail()` to create Firebase user
- ✅ Saves username to Firestore database
- ✅ Shows success message with username
- ✅ Shows error message if registration fails
- ✅ Navigates back to landing page on success

**What Happens Now:**
1. User fills form → Clicks "Register"
2. Loading spinner appears
3. Firebase creates authentication user
4. Firestore stores username + email + timestamp
5. Success message: "Welcome [username]!"
6. User is authenticated and logged in! ✅

---

### 2. `lib/screens/login_page.dart` ✅

**Added Import:**
```dart
import '../services/auth_service.dart';
```

**Updated Login Logic:**
- ✅ Shows loading spinner during login
- ✅ Calls `AuthService.signInWithEmail()` to authenticate
- ✅ Shows success message "Welcome back!"
- ✅ Shows error message if login fails
- ✅ Navigates back to landing page on success

**What Happens Now:**
1. User enters email + password → Clicks "Login"
2. Loading spinner appears
3. Firebase authenticates user
4. Success message appears
5. User is logged in! ✅
