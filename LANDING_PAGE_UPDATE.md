# Landing Page Updated! 🎨

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Removed Live Clock
- **Before**: Had a `_getCurrentTime()` function displaying live time (e.g., "18:41 pm")
- **After**: Removed the clock - it was just a notification bar indicator, not needed

### ✅ 2. Using image.png Asset
- **Before**: Custom-coded Queen & King playing cards with crowns (220+ lines of code)
- **After**: Simple `Image.asset('assets/images/image.png')` widget
- **Height**: Set to 300px with `BoxFit.contain` to maintain aspect ratio

---

## Updated Code Structure

### Landing Page Layout (Top to Bottom)
```
1. Decorative circles (gradient background elements)
2. 🖼️ Image.asset - YOUR CARD ILLUSTRATION
3. "Score Card Maintainer" title
4. Description text
5. "Get Started" button → navigates to Register Page
```

---

## File Changes

### `lib/screens/landing_page.dart`
- ❌ Removed: `_getCurrentTime()` function (lines ~189-197)
- ❌ Removed: Time display widget at top
- ❌ Removed: Custom Queen/King card Stack layout (220+ lines)
- ✅ Added: Simple `Image.asset('assets/images/image.png', height: 300)`

## Asset Configuration

### Already Set Up in `pubspec.yaml`
```yaml

  uses-material-design: true
  
  assets:
    - assets/images/  ✅ This includes image.png
    - assets/icons/
```

## What You'll See

2. **Your card illustration image** from `assets/images/image.png` centered
3. **App title** and description below
4. **"Get Started" button** that navigates to the registration page

## Next Steps

Ready for more features! Let me know if you want to:
- Adjust image size/positioning
- Add more pages (dashboard, leaderboard, profile, etc.)
- Connect Firebase authentication
- Add animations or transitions

**Your app is cleaner now with the actual image asset instead of custom-coded cards!** 🚀
