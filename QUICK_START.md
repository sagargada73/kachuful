## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Firebase (REQUIRED)

Choose one of these methods:

#### Method A: Automated Script (Recommended)
```powershell
.\setup_firebase.ps1
```

#### Method B: Manual Setup
See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions, or follow this quick guide:

```powershell
# 1. Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# 2. Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# 3. Login to Firebase
firebase login

# 4. Configure your app
flutterfire configure
```

Then go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and:
- Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
- Create Firestore Database
- Add security rules from `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`

### Step 2: Run the App

```powershell
# For Android
flutter run

# For specific device
flutter devices
flutter run -d <device-id>

# For web
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 📱 Adding More Pages

When you share your next design, I'll implement it! Here's how pages will be added:

### Example: Adding a Login Page

1. I'll create `lib/screens/login_page.dart`
2. Update the "Get Started" button to navigate:
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => LoginPage()),
);
```

### What I Need From You
- 📸 Screenshot or design file of the next page
- 📝 Brief description of functionality
- 🔗 How it connects to other pages

---

## 🔥 Firebase Collections Ready

Your Firebase services are pre-configured for these collections:

### `users`
- Store user profiles
- Methods: `createUser()`, `getUser()`, `updateUser()`

### `scores`
- Track game scores
- Methods: `createScore()`, `getUserScores()`, `updateScore()`, `deleteScore()`

### `games`
- Manage games
- Methods: `createGame()`, `getAllGames()`, `getGamesStream()`

---

## 🛠 Development Commands

```powershell
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run app
flutter run

# Build APK (Android)
flutter build apk

# Build for release
flutter build apk --release

# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Check for errors
flutter analyze

# Run tests (when you add tests)
flutter test

# Generate app icon (requires flutter_launcher_icons)
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Firebase not initialized"
Run `flutterfire configure` to generate proper Firebase config.

### "No devices found"
- Start an Android emulator: `flutter emulators --launch <emulator-id>`
- Or run on web: `flutter run -d chrome`

### Build errors
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Gradle errors (Android)
Check that `android/app/build.gradle` has `minSdkVersion 21` (already configured).
