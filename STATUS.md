## 🎯 What's Next?

### Option 1: View Your Landing Page
The app should now be running in Chrome! Check it out and let me know if any adjustments are needed.

### Option 2: Add Firebase (When Ready)
When you want Firebase back:
1. I'll update to compatible Firebase versions
2. Run `flutterfire configure`
3. Enable Authentication and Firestore in console
4. Everything is already pre-coded and ready!

### Option 3: Add More Pages
Share your next page design and I'll implement it immediately:
- Login/Register screens
- Dashboard/Home
- Score entry form
- Leaderboard
- User profile
- Settings

## 📱 Ready for Your Next Page!

I've successfully implemented your landing page with pixel-perfect design. When you're ready to continue:

1. **Share the next page design** (screenshot, Figma link, or image)
2. **Tell me the page name** (e.g., "Login Page", "Dashboard")
3. **Describe any specific functionality** (optional)

I'll implement it with:
- Matching design
- Proper navigation
- State management
- Form validation (if needed)
- Firebase integration (when we add it back)
