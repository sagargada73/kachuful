# Kachu Ful - Latest Updates Summary

## 🎯 Changes Made (October 6, 2025)

### 1. **Fixed Scoring Logic** ✅

#### Problem:
The "Append 1" mode was incorrectly calculating scores:
- Wrong: Bid 1 = 11, Bid 2 = 21, Bid 3 = 31 (was parsing as string concatenation)
- The issue was using `int.parse('${playerBids[i]}1')` which created 11, 21, 31, etc.

#### Solution:
Changed scoring logic for "Append 1" mode:
```dart
// OLD (WRONG):
score = int.parse('${playerBids[i]}1'); // Bid 2 → "21" → 21 points

// NEW (CORRECT):
score = 10 + playerBids[i]!; // Bid 2 → 10 + 2 → 12 points
```

#### Results:
- **Prepend 0 Mode**: Bid 0→10, Bid 1→10, Bid 2→20, Bid 3→30 ✅
- **Append 1 Mode**: Bid 0→10, Bid 1→11, Bid 2→12, Bid 3→13 ✅

### 2. **Added Round-by-Round Score Table** 📊

#### Features:
- **Round History Table** appears below current scores after first round
- Shows all previous rounds in a compact table
- Each column represents a player
- Each row represents a round
- Color-coded scores:
  - 🟢 Green (+points) = Successful bid
  - 🔴 Red (0) = Failed bid
- **Totals Row** at bottom showing cumulative scores
- Horizontally scrollable for many players

#### Example Display:
```
Round History
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Round | Player1 | Player2 | Player3
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  1   |  +10    |   0     |  +12
  2   |   0     |  +11    |  +10
  3   |  +13    |  +12    |   0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total:|   23    |   23    |   22
```

#### Implementation:
- Added `List<List<int>> roundScores` to track each round's scores
- Scores are recorded when clicking "Next Round"
- Table only shows when history exists (`if (roundScores.isNotEmpty)`)
