## Changes Made

### 1. Added "Next Round" Validation ✅

**File**: `lib/screens/game_score_page.dart`

**What Changed**:
- Added validation to ensure ALL "Won" fields are filled before proceeding to next round
- Prevents scoring errors from empty/missing inputs

**Validation Flow**:
1. ✅ Check if bids are locked (existing)
2. ✅ **NEW**: Check if all "Won" fields have values
3. ✅ Show warning snackbar if any field is empty
4. ✅ Only proceed when all inputs are complete

**Code Added**:
```dart
// Validate that all "Won" fields are filled
bool allWonEntered = true;
for (int i = 0; i < widget.numberOfPlayers; i++) {
  if (wonControllers[i].text.isEmpty) {
    allWonEntered = false;
    break;
  }
}

if (!allWonEntered) {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(
      content: Text(
        '⚠️ Please enter tricks won for all players!',
        style: GoogleFonts.inter(),
      ),
      backgroundColor: Colors.orange,
      behavior: SnackBarBehavior.floating,
    ),
  );
  return;
}
```

**User Experience**:
- 🚫 Can't proceed with empty fields
- ⚠️ Clear warning message shown
- ✅ Prevents calculation errors
- ✅ Forces complete data entry

### 2. Added Login & Register Access 🔐

**File**: `lib/screens/game_setup_page.dart`

**What Changed**:
- Added Login and Register options to navigation drawer
- Users can now access authentication pages from game setup
- **No pages were deleted** - they were always there, just not accessible

**New Navigation Options**:
```
Navigation Drawer:
├── Help
├── Score History
├── Home
├── ─────────── (divider)
├── 🔑 Login       ← NEW
└── 👤 Register    ← NEW
```

**How to Access**:
1. Open app (starts at Game Setup)
2. Tap hamburger menu (☰) in top-left
3. Scroll down to see Login and Register options
4. Tap to navigate to authentication pages

**Files Confirmed Present**:
- ✅ `lib/screens/login_page.dart` - Exists and functional
- ✅ `lib/screens/register_page.dart` - Exists and functional
- ✅ `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Firebase auth working

## Complete Validation System

### Phase 1: Enter Bids
- ❌ **Cannot lock** until all bid fields filled
- Warning: "⚠️ Please enter bids for all players first!"

### Phase 2: Enter Won
- ❌ **Bids locked** - cannot modify
- ❌ **Cannot proceed** until all won fields filled
- Warning: "⚠️ Please enter tricks won for all players!"

### Result:

## Firebase Integration Status
